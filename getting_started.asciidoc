== AsciiDoc Overview

http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc] is a text document format for writing (among other things) books, ebooks, documentation, and ebooks. The main advantages of AsciiDoc is that it is easy to use and plays well with O'Reilly's publishing process.  It's similar to wiki markup -- if you can write a wikipedia article, then you're pretty much 90% of the way there. 

This http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat sheet] covers a lot of the nitty gritty, but the following sections will give you an overview of the markup you'll use most frequently.  

=== Plain Text

Most of what you'll be doing is just writing plain old text. There's nothing special here -- just write what you have to say.  The only thing to remember is to NOT use any inline formatting -- like bold, italic, or others.  Just focus on the writing, not the appearance, and you'll do fine.

=== Hyperlinks

To add a hyperlink, just type the URL followed by the description in brackets.  Do not put a space between the brackets and the URL.  Here's an example:

=== Simple Tables

=== Cross references

== Figures and Code



== Structuring the document

Main "home page," "book.asciidoc" is the main index into your document

Treat this as a granular TOC or index page

Don't put section headers in the "content" -- put them only in "book.asciidoc" with link out to each section.
