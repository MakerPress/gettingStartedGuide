== Signing In With OpenID

The editing environment requires authentication using http://openid.net/[OpenID].  There are many, many providers, ranging from Goolge, Flickr, myOpenID, to Verisign.  Each provides a distinct identifier that you use to identify yourself.  This section describes use the Google+ OpenID service.  

[NOTE]
====
Unlike other providers, Google+ does not require you to provide a distinct identifier.  Rather, you use a single, generic identifier -- *https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id* -- which Google+ uses to retrieve your unique identity URL.  Please note that this identifier is not specific to your account, and that you do not need to replace "id" (or anything else) with anything specific to your account.  This is all done for you automatically.
