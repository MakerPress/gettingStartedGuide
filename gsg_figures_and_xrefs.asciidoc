== Figures and cross-references (XREFS)

Do not use the JPEG file format for saving screenshots, as they work poorly in print. Please use GIF, TIF, PNG, or BMP. To add a figure to your project, just place the figure file in the "attachments" directory (click the Upload Attachment button in the upper right of the screen) and add a link, like this:

====
 [[figure1]]
 .Put the caption here

 image::attachments/figure1.png[scaledwidth=90%]
====

Figures can "float" throughout the document and may not be on the same page you expect them to be. For this reason, saying things like "This figure..." or "The figure below..." might confuse the reader, since the figure may very well be on a totally separate page once the document is rendered.  For this reason, all figures must have an accompanying cross-reference.  

Cross-references (XREFS) allow you to link to other sections in the document, and are most commonly used to refer to figures.  XREFS have two elements: an anchor, which is what you're linking _to_, and a reference, which is where you're linking _from_ in your text. Anchor links are denoted by double brackets. Reference links are denoted with double angle-brackets.  

Here's a sample of how you'd reference a figure:

====
   You can see an example of foo in <<foo-figure>>.  Notice how beautiful the foo is.  Mmmmm, foo.

   [[foo-figure]]
   .Here is the caption for foo

   image::attachments/some_figure_related_to_foo.png[scaledwidth=90%]
====

To generate a cross-reference, use this syntax:

----
<<ID>>
----

where `ID` is the anchor or BlockID of the target, which you place in double square-brackets above that block.
