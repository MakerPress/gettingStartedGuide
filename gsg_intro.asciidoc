= Getting Started with Gollum

== Introduction

This is a pilot for an experimental way to develop short-form (less than 100 pages or so) content for O'Reilly.  Here's how it works:

* We supply you with a https://github.com/github/gollum[Gollum] instance, the awesome, git-powered wiki from the folks at http://www.github.com[GitHub].  You write/edit your document like you would a wiki, and you can share it with friends, editors, and other people you think might help.
* You write in AsciiDoc, an open source text format developed by http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Stuart Rackham] (more on this in a bit).  Every time you save a page, it gets logged into a git repository, so it's always under version control.  (We can grant you access to your repo -- just ask!)
* When you're ready, we suck the AsciiDoc into our publishing toolchain, convert it to DocBook (our native format), and then push it out through various channels.  You can read a bit about this at http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg's blog], where he describes how he wrote his "Programming iOS" book.  The editing environment provides some tools to help you "debug" your markup to meet DocBook's stringent requirements.

So, why bother with this, you ask?  Mostly, we're trying to create a more appealing process that will get you writing as quickly as possible, not mucking around with a bunch of tools.  The cool thing about AsciiDoc, Gollum, and git (and GitHub!) is that they can help ease a lot of the complexities of the publishing process, letting you (hopefully!) focus on the what you want to say.

This document covers:

* Signing in with OpenID
* Getting started with AsciiDoc
* Attaching figures and code samples
* Putting code examples on GitHub
* Building the project
* Debugging your project
* Downloading your archive
* Editing locally
* Tips and tricks

So, here come the rest of the sections.
