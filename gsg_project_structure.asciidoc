== Structuring the document

Creating more complex documents is simply a matter of stitching together smaller sub documents.  While there are a variety of approaches, the one we're recommending right now (this is a pilot, after all, so this might change) is to use the special file "home.asciidoc" as a granular TOC or index page. So, basically, you put all the section headers that describe the piece's structure, and then have links out to the content pages. Keeping the structure in one place (home) will make it easier to move things around as you rewrite and edit. The idea looks something like <<doc-structure>>.

So, how do you do this? Basically, just put all your structural headings (defined by nesting equal signs at various depths) in the home file, and then put internal links (which are the page name enclosed in double brackets). Note that you don't have to create each content page first -- you can simply create a link the link. When you click on it, the new page will be created automatically. The following sample should give you the basic idea.

In addition to making the document more manageable, this approach also has the benefit of helping you think through the outline and structure of the document.
